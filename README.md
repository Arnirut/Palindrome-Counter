# Palindrome-Counter
I created this program after being inspired by a video created by Numberphile called "What's special about 196?" 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN8PE3eljdA: Check it out!
Dr. James Grime was fascinated with the number 196 after finding out that it was a number that was infinitely looping when using his reverse and add "game" 
I wanted to test out this magic number and to my surprise. 196 breaks the program! 
Feel free to use this code and if you notice I can improve on anything or overlooked, let me know!
